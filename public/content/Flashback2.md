        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #007bff; margin-bottom: 4rem;">🌟 Introduction</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
            In 1992, Flashback revolutionized action gaming and gained legendary status, ranking among the 100 best video games in history.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
            Today, Paul Cuisset, the creator of the original game, invites you to play again as Conrad B. Hart, the young agent of the GBI (Galactic Bureau of Investigation).
            In the 22nd century, the peace of the United Worlds extends throughout the Solar System — but this tranquility is threatened by the Morph invasion led by the fearsome General Lazarus.
            In search of his lifelong friend, Ian, and with the help of his few allies — including A.I.S.H.A., his iconic AI-powered weapon — Conrad, once again, dives into a heart-pounding adventure full of twists, turns and revelations!
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            A gripping, fluid and intricate platform shooter, including exploration, puzzle solving and, of course, adventure!
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the chance to participate on the production of the Patch-3 of the game after his lunch on steam, the patch was looking like a big rework of the game, fixing a lot of issues, bigs and features causing obstacle to the good fun of the game.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            Flashback 2 is mostly a shooter and platformer game, the player will have to explore different areas, buildings or regions. Collect some story keys objects, and of course kill enemies to advance further.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            Different kind of exotic gameplay are added on top of that, there are mecha fights, driving bike, even finding some electrical circuits to hack. They were added to make more gameplay mechanics in the game, and give a little bit of more things to learn for the player, creating challenge + satisfaction understanding new mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also a lot of narrative parts, cutscenes and dialogues, creating the lore and some storyline through the game with lot of different characters..
        </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        Maybe the earlier and easier, when I joined the project my first and main task was to play the game, the Lead Game Designer wanted me to play it, with a fresh look and complete unknowing of the story, universe and gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        He wanted me to write a little essay, explaining all the things I understood of the game, story and chatacters. The things I liked and disliked, understood and misunderstood, and mostly the things that were too much or lacking for me.  
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: -2rem;">
                        The things I liked the most were kinda easy, the new universe, learning the game with new mechanics and features, the different characters and lore of this world.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: -2rem;">
                        And for the dislike or misunderstood part it was more like.. Some of the characters are starting some relationships togethers, but it's not used the way I would use it, or go more into that (exemple Conrad and Helen having a romance, but only during like 3 mins on the whole game, I was a bit dissapointed).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        On the other hand, I was also dissapointed by some mechanics being used only once in the game, could have been a really great use if used multiple times, like the mecha fights or some hackings in the early early game (limit tutorial city).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        In the end my Lead was really happy and surprised about my essay, saying the he had forgotten the use and meaning of some of the parts I spoke about. Sadly we didn't had the time to use more of thoses mechanics and place them elsewhere, but at least the essay was done.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: -2rem;">
                        My 2nd task was more straight forward, once i've finished played I had to watch some footage and gameplay of the old version of the game (The one that was published at the time, not the reworked version we were working on).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
                        Inside a big google doc, I firstly had to create a recap of all the new features or modifications between the actual version and the one we were working on. Including the pros and cons of the actual version, and comparing them to the new one (That had of course only advantages compared to the actual).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        Once that full recap finished I had then to create a powerpoint destined to the publishers and the marketing team, showcasing them all the new features, advancement, modifications and fixes we did during the upcoming Patch.3 (the version we were working on).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        This one was also very interesting to make, for the first time I had to make documents that were going to be seen by high persons in the studio.

        <div style="margin-left: 3.5rem;"><p>
            I learnt so much on this project, even more since it was my first ever professional project.
        </p>
        <p>From organizing tasks proprely with Slack and ClickUp, creating and managing task tickets for my own work, to redact professional documents for the marketing team of the studio, it was a truely awesome experience.</p>
        <p>I also learnt of course the importance of users's feedbacks, since the entire Patch.3 was based on thoses, modifying features or fixing some bugs.</p>
        <p>It was truely an amazing first experience and I could have never dreamt of a better first step in the video game industry than this one.</p></div>
