        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #007bff; margin-bottom: 4rem;">🌟 Introduction</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            <i>AlzMemory?</i> is a short narrative game that immerses players in the fragmented mind of a father battling Alzheimer’s. Through intimate vignettes, the game explores his struggles with fading memories and the emotional weight of past regrets, as his children, grandmother, and subconscious bring buried feelings to the surface.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            We created this project for the Hauts-de-Seine Festival, where the theme was Courage. My goal during this project was to guide players into feeling and thinking through a character with his own story and background.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular narrative, we chose to focus on Alzheimer’s. I had to research the illness and design interactive mini-games within the dialogue to help players engage directly with its impact on people’s lives.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            The game is very simple. Players click to progress through the dialogue and play small mini-games using their mouse.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            Since it’s short and linear, the dialogue flows naturally, and players just need to click to follow the story. When a mini-game appears, players can interact and complete it easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal was to create a narrative-driven experience with interactive moments that help players understand the illness and its effects on daily life.

                        Together with Yann, the second Game Artist, we wrote the dialogue lines and defined the roles and placement of each character in the game.

                        The first mini-game begins when the grandmother talks about a spider the twins should dig up in the garden. The goal is to help the father understand what she’s saying, despite his confused thoughts.

                        This one is tied to a sad and emotional moment. Lost in his mind, the father imagines speaking to his late father. They talk about kindness and how to honor the death of a living creature, digging a grave and saying a few heartfelt words.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
                        A chatbox appears with invisible words. A fuse begins to burn, and rain falls inside the box. The mouse cursor becomes an umbrella. The player must shield the burning fuse from the rain to reveal the word, letter by letter. Once a word is complete, a new fuse starts burning, and the player must quickly move the umbrella to protect it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                        If the rain touches the fuse, the word resets and the player must start that fuse again.

                        Since it’s a narrative-focused game, I didn’t want players to lose or restart unchanged dialogue, that would be frustrating. Instead, mistakes just trigger a quick reset, nothing major.

        <div style="margin-left: 3.5rem;"><p>
            - I learned how hard it is in a small project like this to make characters truly impactful for players, along with the story itself.
        </p>
        <p>- I feel the game lacked interaction, mini-games, and dialogue options, it leaned too much toward a “click-through” experience.</p>
        <p>- Still, I loved the project’s art and universe design. I would’ve liked to make the narration a bit lighter and more engaging, so players could connect with the father more easily and enjoy interacting with the family.</p></div>
