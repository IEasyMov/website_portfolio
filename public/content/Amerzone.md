            I work on this project for few weeks only during my Internship at Microïds Studio Paris (MSP), I had no particular objective as amazed I was from the game and universe, I wanted to discover and explore it. 
        </p>
        <p>The production of the game was already advanced so I had really specific tasks on it, mostly to help the good continuation of the developpement of it.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            L'Amerzone is an exploration and adventure game where the player will slide from areas to areas, clicking on the screen on different arrows to move him from scenes to scenes.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            Collecting objects, documents and even radio recordings. The player will be able to interact a lot with his surrounding. Also having an inventory and journal will able the player to use all thoses objects and read again the hits or lore pages to succed into advancing in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game being narrativly driven, a lot of mini cutscenes and events will occurs, leading the player into new environments and areas to discover and explore.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        I had the chance to work on that project only during few weeks, my main tasks were to ease the life of the main Game Designer of the project by sorting all the informations and making it more clear.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        Mainly, I made multi documents containing all the objects, their use, when the player obtain them, where to use them.. If there is a text on it or interactions directly on the objects. And if the player keep or not the object after using it / moving from a chapter to another.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: -2rem;">
                        Since the project was already really advanced, I had the chance to playtest the game entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
                        By making me do so, Romain, the Lead Game Designer of the project wanted me to try and see if there were any incoherence in the texts, in the lore, interactions or order of the story in the game.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                        I also found bunch of bugs and issues that helped a lot fixing some of the blocking points in the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To finish, playtesting that way helped them also making sure that a new player, knowing nothing from the story, game or it's universe was able to understand and find out the solutions for each little enigmas and puzzles. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        It was mostly to add or not some hints in the game to help the players not getting lost at every new puzzle or areas.
                    </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 3.5rem;"><p>
            I learnt quickly the importance of documenting and sorting everything in a project, whichever the size is, to make sure nothing is lost, and more important, that everyone has the same view on each parts.
        </p>
        <p>Making sure that the mechanics, puzzles and features are understandables by everyone, some hints can be pleasant in games, but it has to have the right balance, not too easy nor too hard</p>
