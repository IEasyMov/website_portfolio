        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
            Doc! We need you! Our little monster Paco requires your help. As an expert you should be able to fix him.. Right?
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6rem;">
            You only have to put your head between his teeth and your arms in his guts to keep Paco alive.
            Just don't lose your head in the process!
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
            The player takes on the role of a monster vet, who has to put his head in Paco's mouth (the monster) and his hands in holes in his chest to reach his organs and keep him alive for 3 minutes!
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.rem;">
            We had a lot of fun building different inputs to fill the roles of the organs, such as an enema bulb to squeeze to the rhythm of a heartbeat for the heart, balloons full of flour for the lungs, and finally switches covered in cotton wool for the brain. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            This project was very particular because it was a physical game, plus it was Alternative Controler kind..

        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
            Basicly the game is made by 3 mini-games, on the screen you can see 3 boxes on the left side, and some gauges on the right side.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">Each gauge represent one organ, when the organ's mini-game starts, the gauge starts decreasing too until the game is completed, which put back the gauge to the max.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">If two gauges decrease to zero the game will be lost, you have to keep Paco alive for 2 minutes, with then at least 2 organs alive.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #007bff;">👨‍💻 What I've realized on the project</h2>
        <ul style="font-size: 120%;">
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

        <span style="color:rgb(164, 208, 255); font-weight: bold;  font-size: 120%">The game concept</span>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                    The first task, but if not the most important of the project, was to find a novative and original concept for that alternative controller game.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">
                    Scotty Fermin and me were the first to work on it, since it was a week dedicated of finding an idea, before creating a whole team.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
                    We had two main ideas, one being a toilet box where the player would have to play with the toilet broom, the flush, and with the screen being in the toilet hole.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    The second idea being Paco's idea. A big monster with holes in his body, the player would have to put his hands in it and play with his organs to do something (we hadn't choose it would be o keep him alive as a vet at first).
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">
                    We then decided to push a bit the monster idea and created a powerpoint presentation, the main objective now would be to make the idea and concept the most attractive possible.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                    (Why ? Because the first week were only Scotty and me (2 GD's), then during the weekend, we'll send our powerpoint and the other students would choose the one they like the most among all the concepts, and place themselves in each teams, it was a great idea to create teams in my opinion).

        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;margin-top: 6.5rem;">
            <b style="color: #007bff;">The heart</b> - The heart is basicly a pump that the player has to press with his hand inside of the hole. On the screen, we show you a line on which a heartbeat will appear, like a rythm
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">You have to press the heart / pump with your hand firmly each time the heartbeat reach the line to do one beat.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">You have to complete as much heartbeat in a row as there are beats on the exemple line, each time you complete one, one symbol on the exemple line will turn green, if you fail one, everything reset.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;margin-top: 3rem;">
            <b style="color: #007bff;">The lungs</b> - For that part it was the hardest of them three to do, we wanted to have a feeling like cow utters to pull, a bit like if you were touching thin lungs (times 3, he's a monster afterall).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">We made it with ballons filled with flour, for the pressing part so they're a bit hard but soft in the same time.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">For the mini-game on the other hand it's easy, you have to pull the lungs to fill up the oxygen jauge of the monster (3 jauges, for the three lungs to pull). Once they're all pulled and so filled in game, the mini-game is complete.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;margin-top: 3rem;">
            <b style="color: #007bff;">The brain</b> - The brain must have been the quickest of them 3 to do, basicly there is 5 little neurons (it's switches on/off buttons) inside of the brain's hole in Paco's chest.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">We give on the game screen a code (ex: off, on, on, off, off) and the actual state of the neurons.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">The player has to find them and activate them one by one to complete the code and validate the game.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #007bff;">📌 Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            During the project I learnt the importance of organization, mostly during the ordering of the fur, the electronics inputs and material. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also playtesting each little mechanics and features as soon possible is primordial, it's sometimes longer for a dev to return on something finished hours/days ago and that just got playtested, than asking for a live playtest and modifying things instantly after the feedbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, since we got selected and invited to the GDC Edition 2025, we learnt the importance of the visuals, all the efforts for marketing and attractivness of our project and how to make the player's experience the best possible!

            Project made in 2 weeks on Unity + Physicly Handmade monster
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The team :</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">- Programmers : Victor Lacombe, Santino Romero, Ema Ouardi</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">- Designers : Scotty Fermin & Me</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">- Artists : Chaher Himaya & Marion Puigcerver</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">- Producer : Lionel Bourgeois</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">The game is sadly not playable from home since the monster is required for the game to be working, however there are some gameplay videos a above on the page</p>
